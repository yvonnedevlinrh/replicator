## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Guardrails

- **NEVER modify source code** — this command updates
  spec artifacts ONLY. Implementation changes belong in
  `/speckit.implement`, `/unleash`, or `/cobalt-crush`.
- **NEVER modify test files, Go source, Markdown agents,
  convention packs, or config files** outside the
  `specs/NNN-*/` feature directory.
- The ONLY files this command may write are:
  - `FEATURE_SPEC` (the spec.md file)
  - Files within `FEATURE_DIR` (spec artifacts:
    plan.md, tasks.md, research.md, data-model.md,
    quickstart.md, contracts/, checklists/)
