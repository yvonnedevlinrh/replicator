## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Dewey Discovery** (optional): Before researching
   unknowns, query Dewey for prior research decisions
   in related specs to avoid re-investigating solved
   problems:
   - `dewey_search` for "research.md" to find prior
     research decisions across completed specs
   - `dewey_semantic_search` with the feature topic to
     find related architectural decisions
   - Incorporate discovered decisions into the research
     phase rather than re-deriving them
   - If Dewey is unavailable (MCP tools return errors or
     are not configured), skip this step and proceed
     with standard research.

2. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

3. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

4. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - If `.specify/config.yaml` exists, read `project_type` to determine the contract format (library → public API, cli → command schema, web → endpoints, mobile → screens)
   - Otherwise, infer the contract format from the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## Guardrails

- **NEVER modify source code** — this command updates
  spec artifacts ONLY. Implementation changes belong in
  `/speckit.implement`, `/unleash`, or `/cobalt-crush`.
- **NEVER modify test files, Go source, Markdown agents,
  convention packs, or config files** outside the
  `specs/NNN-*/` feature directory.
- The ONLY files this command may write are:
  - `FEATURE_SPEC` (the spec.md file)
  - Files within `FEATURE_DIR` (spec artifacts:
    plan.md, tasks.md, research.md, data-model.md,
    quickstart.md, contracts/, checklists/)
